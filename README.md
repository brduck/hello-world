# hello-world

Hello,

I'm Brian and I work as a Web Designer & Developer. I care a lot about well designed UX and I do a lot of testing to make sure my projects work properly. I'll be adding projects to my GitHub account and hope to use it for version control and to show off what I've been working on. When I'm not working I enjoy pour-over coffee, cooking, local craft beer, walking by the ocean and photography.

Thanks for reading this!
Brian
